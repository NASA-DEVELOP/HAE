# HAE
Using the cloud-based computing power of Google Earth Engine (GEE), the Hydrologic Anomaly Index (HAE) is capable of uploading and analyzing large amounts of Earth observation climate data for the purpose of hydrologic analysis and monitoring. The end-user will be able to pull from and modify a library of scripts that are stored in Earth Engine, as well as upload and access data stored on a private data catalog. The final stage of development of the tool will include a more user-friendly application built using Googleâ€™s App Engine, in which users will be able to display data products and interactive maps.
